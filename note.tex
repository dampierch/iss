We did not review the histopathology of this sample.
Therefore, this report cannot be considered equivalent to a pathologic diagnosis.
Nevertheless, DNA methylation-based tumor classification using versions 11b6 and 12b6 of the DKFZ/Heidelberg classifier as well as the NCI/Bethesda classifier results in a \input{tmp/score_type.tex} match to the \input{tmp/diagnosis.tex} methylation class.
Dimensionality reduction with UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) places the query sample in a region enriched for samples with methylation class \input{tmp/bethesda.tex}.
Overall, the consensus methylation profile is most consistent with \input{tmp/diagnosis.tex}.
