Output from the Illumina iScan reader was received in Molecular Pathology as one green and one red IDAT file.
Signal processing, methylation-based tumor classification, 1p/19q copy number status, and MGMT promoter methylation analysis were carried out using established classifiers obtained from the DKFZ in Heidelberg, Germany, as applied using an in-house pipeline as well as using an in-house classifier developed at the NCI.
Testing for 1p/19q copy number, where appropriate, has been clinically validated using DNA copy number analysis derived from the array data.
