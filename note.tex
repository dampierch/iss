DNA methylation-based tumor classification using versions 11b6 and 12b6 of the DKFZ/Heidelberg classifier as well as the NCI/Bethesda classifier results in low-score matches to PXA and GBM RTK2.
Unsupervised clustering using graph-based modularity optimization partitions the query sample with most of the high-score PXA samples in the NCI database, and dimensionality reduction with UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) places the query sample in a region enriched for high-score PXA samples.
Overall, the consensus methylation profile is most consistent with PXA.
