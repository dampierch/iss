We did not review the histopathology of this sample.
Therefore, this report cannot be considered equivalent to a pathologic diagnosis.
Nevertheless, we analyzed the DNA methylation signal in the submitted IDAT files
and performed DNA methylation-based tumor classification using versions 11b6 and
12b6 of the DKFZ/Heidelberg classifier as well as the NCI/Bethesda classifier.
